Project Two

Requirements:
- Use the USGS Earthquake GeoJSON API (choose any of the live feeds)
- Display the earthquake data on your page (optionally using Handlebars)
- Style the page with a CSS file
- Add some other interactive feature of your choosing. E.g. a live refresh function, a map, etc.
- Track your code in Git

Project:
Although the Earthquake Data isn't displayed using handlebars, I used three divs with unordered lists to display the earth quake data in columns. 

Additionally, the page refreshes every minute to display the most up to date data.
