Project Details

I am trying to build a website for a new club on campus, Documentary Club. 

Things already completed:
-Have at least one HTML file
-Have at least one CSS file
-Tracking Project using git

The html file is the index.html or home page of the website. It doesn't display much content besides the navigation bar and a block reveal
effect for the website title. 

Things still need to be done:
- Edit the nav-bar so that its color, hover and active attributes match the color scheme of the webpage
- Fix the block reveal colors to cover the whole title
- Introduce a loading of the website when page is called
- Make it responsive for mobile usage
